              <p>I built this ePortfolio to showcase who I am as a developer and how far I have come. Across this program and capstone, I’ve moved from putting things together as I go to building something that is organized, secure, and user-friendly. I am proud of this work and stand behind it. Creating this portfolio pushed me to work on old project, explain my choices, and bring everything together to meet real goals. That process showed my strengths in full-stack web and mobile development, practical problem-solving, and a steady, optimistic mindset about what technology can do for people.</p>

              <p>Coursework and especially the capstone has helped me connect my day-to-day skills to a bigger and better professional goal. I enjoy turning ideas into working products that real uses can enjoy without difficulties. For example, I turned an Android inventory application into InvenTitan, a cross-platform Flutter app with full create/read/update/delete features and a simple, clean layout backed behind a local database. On the web side, I improved Tralvr Getaways, my MEAN-stack project, by improving the sign-in flow and improving the administrative experience with more route protection and better forms. Together, these projects helped shape my values to make things more dependable, make them easy to use, and keep security in mind from the start.</p>

              <p>I have grown a lot in how I would like to collaborate and communicate. Through Scrum exercises and peer feedback in earlier courses, I learned to break things into simpler steps, review code respectfully, and give constructive comments that can help move a team forward. In my professional role working alongside a NOC (Network Operations Center), I translate a lot the technical issues going on into plain language, so non-technical teammates can make decisions quickly. The capstone’s code-review video and the way I built this site put those habits on display. I explain what the code does, why I want to change it, and how it improves the overall reliability and user experience without drowning people in terminology. Building the ePortfolio on Github pages also reminded me that presentation matter so I supplied navigation and clear writing as part of the product.</p>

              <p>My understanding of data structures and algorithms became much more important over time. In CS 260 I compared options like arrays, hash tables, and trees and implemented a quicksort; later, I applied that mindset to real features like efficient lookups, search, and filtering in the trips listing so screens feel fast instead of sluggish. There was also an Intelligent Pirate Agent project that improved my comfort level with step-by-step improvement where I can try something simple, measure it, and iterate until my agent can reach the goal every time. Studying things like actor-critic methods helped me look at trade-offs without needing to be overly mathematical in every explanation. Using this information allowed me to test different models of automation and prediction when implementing features for InvenTitan, giving me a solid foundation of future improvements and modifications for the application’s future.</p>

              <p>On the software engineering and database side, I focused on design, clarity, and durable choices. In Travlr Getaways I improved the admin workflow with a clean login, guarded routes, and more helpful form experience. On the backend, I reinforced input check and kept endpoints predictable, which will make bugs much easier to find and fix. For data, I have worked with both MongoDB which is great for flexible documentation, and SQLite in InvenTitan which shines as reliable offline storage for mobile devices. These choices fit each project’s needs and keep the maintenance realistic. Along the way I kept a security mindset by validating inputs, using token-based access for protected actions, and following the secure-coding habits I practiced throughout my coursework like enforcing encryption, hashing, and safer defaults. Reverse-engineering and static-analysis also trained me to look for blind spots early on, allowing me to catch issues before they became risks.</p>

              <p>Here is an idea of how the artifacts in this portfolio fit together in this capstone. Travlr Getaways shows my full-stack web skills, database design, and attention to UX and security on a site people can actually use. InvenTitan shows that I can take a working idea, modernize and change it, and use it on multiple platforms while keeping data safe and the interface clean. The AI and algorithms work shows my problem-solving by starting simple, looking at the results, and refining them until it is stable. Together, they show my growth towards becoming a balanced developer: someone who can design the experience, build the system, optimize the performance, and protect the user.</p>

              <p>Putting this all together made me a better overall developer not just because I know someone, but because I can deliver a complete solution and communicate what it does. I have learned to better work with others across different roles, set goals, and explain my work in a way anyone can follow. I am excited to keep growing as a developer bringing my optimism, care for the users, and a mindset set is a foundation of security to the next team I have the pleasure of working with and the next product I help build.</p>

        <p>
          Hi, I’m Cortland Burns! Over the last two years I’ve grown from building single-app solutions to delivering
          <strong>secure, production-ready systems</strong> across web and mobile. My focus is <em>application development</em>,
          <em>full-stack design</em>, and <em>secure architecture</em>—with hands-on work hardening auth flows, validating inputs,
          and automating builds/tests. For mobile <strong>Flutter</strong> projects I integrate cloud services; the
          <strong>Travlr (MEAN)</strong> project remains vendor-agnostic.
